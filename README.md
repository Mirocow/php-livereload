Q&A

1. Why did you use PHP code instead of FAM module in PHP?
Because FAM module is system dependent. Futhermore, PECL modules have problem to keep up with PHP head versions.

2. Why did you not use WebSocket?
Because I have not found, so far, any WebSocket implementation in PHP which inspired confidence on me. But this idea is still strong in my mind and might be implemented in near future.
